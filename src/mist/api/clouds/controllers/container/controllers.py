"""Cloud ContainerControllers

A cloud container controller handles all container operations that can be
performed on a cloud, commonly using libcloud under the hood.

It also performs several steps and combines the information stored in the
database with that returned from API calls to provider services.

For each different cloud type, there is a corresponding cloud container
controller defined here. All the different classes inherit
BaseContainerController and share a commmon interface, with the exception that
some controllers may not have all methods implemented.

A cloud container controller is initialized given a cloud. Most of the time,
it is accessed through a cloud model, using the `ctl` abbreviation, like this:

    cloud = mist.api.clouds.models.Cloud.objects.get(id=cloud_id)
    print(cloud.ctl.container.list_clusters())
